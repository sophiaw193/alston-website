    'The <i>Morality</i> of Cheating',
    'February 9th, 2021',
    '
    Yesterday, I was scrolling through my newsfeed on Facebook when I stumbled upon a post about cheating on exams posted in a networking group. The author attached a screenshot from a Reddit thread in which an anonymous user explained that there is nothing morally wrong with cheating on tests/school. He or she went on to support their argument with an example: ‚Äú99% of bartenders...use google to find the recipes for [cocktails].‚Äù The main idea was that since the real world doesn‚Äôt operate in exam conditions, it is not morally wrong to operate in a cheating mindset.
    <br/></br/>
    While reading this post, I noticed the lack of logical reasoning behind the author‚Äôs argument. The author of the post claimed that the real world doesn‚Äôt operate in exam conditions, which I can agree with (in many cases, people are given flexible deadlines and resources). In fact, people in the workplace often consult their colleagues in some form or another. However, the author neglected the fact that students in an institution are bound by an ethical code of conduct, which often has academic integrity as one of the first things. Although the real world does not operate in the same conditions, cheating does not become morally justified as it is a betrayal of oneself, others‚Äô trust, and the integrity of the system within.
    <br/></br/>
    Other comments on the post seem to agree that the argument is flawed. One person cited that ‚Äú[exams] test that you have the ability to reason and follow through a problem.‚Äù He explained that a cheater is claiming that he or she can do these things independently, which makes it morally wrong because, in reality, that person has not been able to accomplish the task by themselves. Another comment was especially alarming; this comment suggested that if we knew our doctors cheated their way through medical school and continued using Google for diagnosis, we would no longer want to see this doctor. The same logic applies for experts in different fields. I think it is just as crucial that the person with the supposed expertise treat others how they want to be treated. From a utilitarian point of view, I do think that most forms of cheating are still morally wrong because after all, none of us would like being lied to.
    <br/></br/>
    All of this talk about cheating brings to mind another topic: lies. In Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs book, <i>The Righteous Mind</i>, he briefly mentioned the topic of lying. His theory was that lying was an intuitive response in our minds aimed to defend our self-righteousness. In fact, it is often performed for socially strategic messages. I remember when I lied to my professor in an email about missing an upcoming class in a seminar that required attendance. I was visiting friends at another university, and I knew that I would not get back on campus on that day. So I told my professor that I was going to my cousin‚Äôs wedding. In retrospect, I can see how I used lying to defend myself from being penalized. Had I stated the right cause of my inability to attend the class, my professor would have said something along the lines of ‚Äúwell, you see that is not a valid excuse for missing class.‚Äù Therefore, I do not think it was morally wrong to lie there; but I could be wrong, as I was simply backing up my intuition with strategic reasoning.
    <br/></br/>
    Although lying, in my opinion, is a less severe form of cheating, I am interested in how we can address the moral problems surrounding these topics down the line. It may be worthwhile to begin altering the process in which students are measured at school. From my school experiences, exam grades were not reflective of my knowledge but, more so, my work ethic in the preparation phase. Therefore, those who spent more time studying generally received better grades (although there are many exceptions, mostly geniuses who were excellent at memorizing). In retrospect, I think that there should be a shift to more projects/collaboration amongst students. Not only will these types of assignments prepare them for the real world, but it will also incentivize them to pull their own weight and work harder. As humans, we have a tendency to care about how others perceive us. In a group setting, students can learn to build confidence in working with others and gain perspectives from others in the teams.
    <br/></br/>
    I‚Äôd like to think that humans are all <b>moral creatures</b> and that the distractions in the world only serve to prevent us from finding our <b>honest and moral selves.</b>

    'The Mob Mentality',
    'January 25th, 2021',
    '
    A recent phenomenon in the Financial industry is the increasing stock value of Gamestop (GME), perpetuated by mobs of anonymous social media users on Reddit forum called WallStreetBets (WSB). Throughout the past three weeks, I‚Äôve followed their journey from the time when the stock was valued at $20 to today, where it peaked around ~$155.
    <br/></br/>
    Like many others, I have been warned of the risk of trading a stock this volatile. The logic is simple: If a stock suddenly spikes higher, short sellers have to rush to buy back shares. The more that a shorted stock like GME goes up, the bigger the losses become if a short seller doesn not buy back their positions, ultimately creating a squeeze which leads to losses. However, the WSB horde, as an author on <a href="hhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">Bloomberg Wealth</a> describes, managed to turn the tables in the game that short sellers invented, and ‚Äúspinning gold from the complacency of others.‚Äù
    <br/></br/>
    After reading the comments within the forums for the past three weeks, I have discovered that that mob psychology and specifically mob mentality are closely related to the subject at hand. Mob psychology, also known as crowd psychology, is a theoretical approach attempting to explain collective behavior solely on the basis of the psychological states of people who participate. For example, individuals may tend to make decisions differently in groups in comparison to making decisions independently. Depending on the situation, individuals are prone to acting in ways that can be described as ‚Äúout of character,‚Äù especially in scenarios involving other people.
    <br/></br/>
    Ultimately, a mob mentality is formed, where people are joined together by an idea, cost, or belief. I witnessed the mob mentality while scrolling through the reddit posts on WSB. In the three screenshots below, I show posts on the forum as well as comment threads, all pertaining to recent news on the GME stock.
    <br/></br/>
    Figure 1 highlighted two posts, one captioned ‚ÄúIDGAF about making money at this point‚Äù and another captioned ‚Äúwe f*cking did it bois.‚Äù This sense of <b>not me, not you, but us together</b> exemplifies the power of mob mentality. When people are joined together over the belief of one idea (in this case one company/stock), they will go miles to hype their belief up, reinforce their narratives, and reassure others who are on the same boat. I can personally feel how powerful this mutual feeling of belief can influence others to adopt the same attitudes about the same thing.
    <br/></br/>
    Figure 2 is a perfect example of the mob mentality; it is frankly rebellious, yet insipring. Lastly, figure 3 further demonstrates the mob mentality, with members reinforcing their group identity and backing one another up.
    <br/></br/>
    As we can see from the results so far, the number of GME shares have spiked which resulted in short term gains for many investors. While the value of the stock jumps higher and higher, the fear of missing out becomes even more apparent in the community. Leveraging this, the WSB community has collectively helped raise the market cap. I want to leave this blog with a question I had while looking at this phenomenon: Does the mob mentality raise people‚Äôs appetite for risk? Does it exploit human‚Äôs risk-taking nature? Or are humans naturally risk-averse creatures?
    <br/></br/>
    Nevertheless, only time will tell where the fate of GME and its investors will be. In the meantime, <i>GME to the moon</i> üåöüåö

    'Time & Money',
    'January 18th, 2021',
    'Recently, I finished reading a book called Die with zero: Getting all you can from your money and life by Bill Perkins. I first heard of Perkins from watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokerStars_Big_Game">Big Game</a>, where professional poker players buy in with hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Bellagio, the famous casino located in the heart of Las Vegas.
    <br/></br/>
    Perkins wasn‚Äôt like the other players who have dedicated their whole lives to the game. He made his fortune through venture capital in the energy markets and now plays poker as a hobby. I respected Perkins because of his background and aggressive playstyle, which made him a formidable foe for the game‚Äôs pro players.
    <br/></br/>
    When I first heard that he had written a book on money, I knew that I had to add it to my personal development books collection. Here‚Äôs my reflection after reading the book‚Ä¶
    <br/></br/>
    Before reading the book, the concept of dying with zero was foreign; I thought we should aim to die filthy rich to show others how good a life we‚Äôve lived. Throughout the book, Perkins‚Äôs main point was that life experiences are the <b>most important conversions of both time and money.</b> Therefore, it should be a goal to exchange the money earned from our time for valuable life experiences to look back on our death beds.
    <br/></br/>
    In many ways, the themes highlighted in the book reminded me that we should die with not only zero dollars but also with zero regrets. While we may hear this all this time, the idea of maximizing your wealth accumulated throughout your lifetime by spending it all before dying is still a new idea to me.
    <br/></br/>
    Like others, I am absolutely <i>terrified</i> about the thought of running out of money in my later years. At the same time, I have become aware that this fear has made me afraid of spending money. Ultimately, the right balance of spending money recklessly and spending money to create life experiences will guide us to a more fulfilling life.
    <br/></br/>
    That being said, I <i>do not</i> think that everyone should aim to die with zero.
    <br/></br/>
    The philosophy embodied in the book assumes that life ‚Üí time ‚Üí money ‚Üí life experiences. However, it does not consider the possibility of exchanging time and money for things like finding passion, gaining social approval, and forming social connections, all of which can help us build a more fulfilling life.
    <br/></br/>
    I guess my biggest takeaway from the book is to stop being a lazy piece of sh*t and get out of my room to accomplish something with the ample amount of time I have at the moment. If life is all about creating life experiences, perhaps we should all get out of there and make something out of nothing.

    'Capitol Hill',
    'January 6th, 2021',
    '2021 may have just started, but chaos remains imminent in the United States. As a Pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol Building on this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/washington-dc-protests">day</a>, the whole world is closely observing as the incident escalates.
    <br/></br/>
    Although I would not categorize myself as a liberal nor conservative, some of my values and morals are reflected upon the policies of the left (pro-choice, pro-gay-marriage, pro-environment, just to name a few). At the same time, I recognize that while I do agree upon ideologies and policies that resemble the Democratic party, I could be a victim of an echo chamber from the prevalence of social media technologies. As a citizen, I take the freedom of free-thinking for granted.
    <br/></br/>
    Therefore, I am meticulous and aware of every step on social media because I do firmly believe that in order to formulate a <i>justified</i> opinion on a topic, one <b>needs</b> to be first informed of the facts of both sides.
    <br/></br/>
    I was having dinner with my mother earlier last week when she asked me if the Democrats had rigged the election (keep in mind that my mom is an immigrant with limited English skills who gets most of her news source from WeChat). Then she pointed out some scandals and flaws of the Democrat party. I was skeptical at first but did not want to immediately debunk her statements because like I said earlier in this post, in order to make justified opinions, one needs to be informed of both sides. The truth was that I was not completely familiar with the stories she shared because I was simply not exposed to any of the same sources on the platforms that I use. What I did suggest to her is for her to watch videos and stories from the other side (later I realized that was an impossible task because most, if not all, Chinese-reported news on WeChat seemed to be pro-Trump, which brings the question: Why are <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/11/13/liberal-chinese-americans-fighting-right-wing-wechat-disinformation/">Chinese sources on WeChat</a> only bringing attention to right-wing news to begin with?). My only logical guess is that the Chinese Community Party is using these news to promote their own agenda. By showing a divise America under the oath of democracy, China aims to make its leadership look as firm and strong as possible.
    <br/></br/>
    What comes to mind is how powerful technology has become in our lives. It has the power to influence communities of people on a global scale almost as if it was a form of brainwashing. In fact, the closest thing that comes remotely close to social media was the mass usage of television in homes back in the mid 20th century. And now it is time to address the ethical concerns.
    <br/></br/>
    Netflix original, titled Social Dilemma, tackled this problem (highly recommend if you have not watched it). The documentary addressed the problem of social media manipulating lives and creating a divisive world through the means of revenue. Now, technology and social media play a bigger role than ever, not only in our daily lives but also in the economy as well as politics.
    <br/></br/>
    The arrival of social media has perpetuated the idea of pushing an agenda through technology. In many ways, we are active consumers of the propaganda formulated on the networks around us. In fact, sensational content will <b>always</b> grab more attention than serious journalism, as shown in the past again and again. However, integrity should <b>never</b> be exchanged for attention. The scariest part is that the technology companies are really the only mediators who can save us from the mess that they have created...'

	'A Fresh Start',
	'Dec 29th, 2020',
	'As 2021 draws closer, a common question that we might get asked is: ‚ÄúWhat is your New Year‚Äôs resolution?‚Äù
	<br/><br/>
	Now, take a moment and think about what you said at the end of last year...
	<br/><br/>
	To be frank, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I set a New Year‚Äôs resolution for myself. And if I did, it would probably be back in high school where I made it my goal to climb the ladders in a video game.
	<br/><br/>
	Over the years, I have stopped making New Year‚Äôs resolutions. It is not because I sucked at accomplishing them, but rather I have become aware of what separates a resolution from just another goal on my bucket list.
    <br/><br/>
	I have some goals on my bucket list, including 1) backpacking in Southeast Asia 2) producing a short film and 3) flying around to play in EPTs (European Poker Tour). The list is only growing as I am getting older. However, I began to notice that different goals on my bucket list required different levels of time, health, and money.
    <br/><br/>
	For example, backpacking in Southeast Asia will take a dedicated amount of time, a healthy body, and relatively smaller amounts of money to complete. Since I <i>should</i> have the most time and the best health in my younger years, I figured I probably <i>should</i> get to that as soon as possible.
    <br/><br/>
	At the same time, I look at other goals of producing a short film and attending poker tournaments as goals that I can accomplish even with deteriorating health in my later years. Therefore, these goals are set at the very bottom of the bucket.
    <br/><br/>
	You might ask what the heck is this guy blabbering about and what does all this have to do with a New Year‚Äôs resolution? Well, I think that these resolutions are inhibiting our ability to perform more.
    <br/><br/>
	One of my friends had made it his New Year‚Äôs resolution to eat healthier so he could lose weight. However, after two and a half weeks of ‚Äúhealthy eating,‚Äù he gave up and resumed his diet from the previous year. Afterward, he convinced himself that he had already failed his resolution for the year and that he would try again next year, hopefully coming back stronger.
    <br/><br/>
	This mentality of <b>attaching a goal to a timeframe</b> (a whole year of 365 days) is problematic. According to a report from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2019/12/21/the-top-3-reasons-new-years-resolutions-fail-and-how-yours-can-succeed/?sh=2d6b84596992">Forbes</a>, around 80% of Americans fail their New Year‚Äôs Resolutions.
    <br/><br/>
    As humans, we are taught that failure builds success. However, this belief provides us with the cushion which ultimately leaves us <b>too much room for failure</b>.
    <br/><br/>
    Instead, I think that we should be actively aware of our resolutions and goals and be able to differentiate them. By no means am I trying to convince you that a New Year‚Äôs resolution is worthless...But I <i>am</i> trying to convince you to be articulate and cautious of what you set your New Year‚Äôs resolution to be. I hope that your takeaway from this is to <b>just</b> do and don‚Äôt think.
    <br/><br/>
    2020 has been a tough year for all of us. I hope that 2021 brings us a fresh start and the future shines a bright light.
    <br/><br/>
    Cheers,
    <br/><br/>
	Alston'
