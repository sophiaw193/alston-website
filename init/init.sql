    'Time & Money',
    'January 21, 2021',
    'Recently, I finished reading a book called Die with zero: Getting all you can from your money and life by Bill Perkins. I first heard of Perkins from watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokerStars_Big_Game">Big Game</a>, where professional poker players buy in with hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Bellagio, the famous casino located in the heart of Las Vegas.
    <br/></br/>
    Perkins wasn’t like the other players who have dedicated their whole lives to the game. He made his fortune through venture capital in the energy markets and now plays poker as a hobby. I respected Perkins because of his background and aggressive playstyle, which made him a formidable foe for the game’s pro players.
    <br/></br/>
    When I first heard that he had written a book on money, I knew that I had to add it to my personal development books collection. Here’s my reflection after reading the book…
    <br/></br/>
    Before reading the book, the concept of dying with zero was foreign; I thought we should aim to die filthy rich to show others how good a life we’ve lived. Throughout the book, Perkins’s main point was that life experiences are the <u>most important conversions of both time and money.</u> Therefore, it should be a goal to exchange the money earned from our time for valuable life experiences to look back on our death beds.
    <br/></br/>
    In many ways, the themes highlighted in the book reminded me that we should die with not only zero dollars but also with zero regrets. While we may hear this all this time, the idea of maximizing your wealth accumulated throughout your lifetime by spending it all before dying is still a new idea to me.
    <br/></br/>
    Like many others, I am absolutely <i>terrified</i> about the thought of running out of money in my later years. At the same time, I have become aware that this fear has made me afraid of spending money. Ultimately, the right balance of spending money recklessly and spending money to create life experiences will guide us to a more fulfilling life.
    <br/></br/>
    That being said, I <i>do not</i> think that everyone should aim to die with zero.
    <br/></br/>
    The philosophy embodied in the book assumes that life → time → money → life experiences. However, it does not consider the possibility of exchanging time and money for things like finding passion, gaining social approval, and forming social connections, all of which can help us build a more fulfilling life.
    <br/></br/>
    I guess my biggest takeaway from the book is to stop being a lazy piece of sh*t and get out of my room to accomplish something with the ample amount of time I have at the moment. If life is all about creating life experiences, perhaps we should all get out of there and make something out of nothing.

    'Capitol Hill',
    'January 6, 2021',
    '2021 may have just started, but chaos remains imminent in the United States. As a Pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol Building on this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/washington-dc-protests">day</a>, the whole world is closely observing as the incident escalates.
    <br/></br/>
    Although I would not categorize myself as a liberal or conservative, some of my values and morals are reflected upon the policies of the left (pro-choice, pro-gay-marriage, pro-environment, just to name a few). At the same time, I recognize that while I do agree upon ideologies and policies that resemble the Democratic party, I could be a victim of an echo chamber from the prevalence of social media technologies. As a citizen, I take the freedom of free-thinking for granted.
    <br/></br/>
    Therefore, I am meticulous and aware of every step on social media because I do firmly believe that in order to formulate a <i>justified</i> opinion on a topic, one <u>needs</u> to be first informed of the facts of both sides.
    <br/></br/>
    I was having dinner with my mother earlier today and she was telling me about how the Democrats may have rigged the election (keep in mind that my mom is an immigrant with limited English skills who gets most of her news source from WeChat). What was intriguing from this conversation was how much of the news over WeChat reflected upon right-wing media.
    <br/></br/>
    I was skeptical but did not want to debunk her statements because like I said earlier in this post, in order to make justified opinions, one needs to be informed of both sides. The truth was that I was not completely familiar with the stories she shared because I was simply not exposed to any of the same sources on the platforms that I use. What I did suggest to her is for her to expose herself to videos and stories from the other side (although that was an impossible task because most, if not all, Chinese-reported news on WeChat were pro-Trump, which brings the question: Why are <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/11/13/liberal-chinese-americans-fighting-right-wing-wechat-disinformation/">Chinese sources on WeChat</a> only bringing attention to right-wing news to begin with?). My only logical guess is that the Chinese Community Party is using these news to promote their own agneda. By showing a divise America under the oath of democracy, China aims to make its leadership look as firm and strong as possible.
    <br/></br/>
    What comes to mind is how powerful technology has become in our lives. It has the power to influence communities of people on a global scale almost as if it was a form of brainwashing. In fact, the closest thing that comes remotely close to social media was the mass usage of television in homes back in the mid 20th century. And now it is time to address the ethical concerns and morality concerns.
    <br/></br/>
    Netflix original, titled Social Dilemma, tackled this problem (highly recommend if you have not watched it). The documentary addressed the problem of social media manipulating lives and creating a divisive world through the means of revenue. Now, technology and social media play a bigger role than ever, not only in our daily lives but also in the economy as well as politics.
    <br/></br/>
    The arrival of social media has perpetuated the idea of pushing an agenda through technology. In many ways, we are active consumers of the propaganda formulated on the networks around us. In fact, sensational content will <b>always</b> grab more attention than serious journalism, as shown in the past again and again. However, integrity should <b>never</b> be exchanged for attention. The scariest part is that the technology companies are really the only mediators who can save us from the mess that they have created...'

	'A Fresh Start',
	'Dec 29, 2020',
	'As 2021 draws closer, a common question that we might get asked is: “What is your New Year’s resolution?”
	<br/><br/>
	Now, take a moment and think about what you said at the end of last year...
	<br/><br/>
	To be frank, I don’t remember the last time I set a New Year’s resolution for myself. And if I did, it would probably be back in high school where I made it my goal to climb the ladders in a video game called League of Legends. (I did peak at Diamond Four, if you were even remotely curious)
	<br/><br/>
	Over the years, I have stopped making New Year’s resolutions. It is not because I sucked at accomplishing them, but rather I have become aware of what separates a resolution from just another goal on my bucket list.
    <br/><br/>
	I have some goals on my bucket list, including 1) backpacking in Southeast Asia 2) producing a short film and 3) flying around to play in EPTs (European Poker Tour). The list is only growing as I am getting older. However, I began to notice that different goals on my bucket list required different levels of time, health, and money.
    <br/><br/>
	For example, backpacking in Southeast Asia will take a dedicated amount of time, a healthy body, and relatively smaller amounts of money to complete. Since I <i>should</i> have the most time and the best health in my younger years, I figured I probably <i>should</i> get to that as soon as possible.
    <br/><br/>
	At the same time, I look at other goals of producing a short film and attending poker tournaments as goals that I can accomplish even with deteriorating health in my later years. Therefore, these goals are set at the very bottom of the bucket.
    <br/><br/>
	You might ask what the heck is this guy blabbering about and what does all this have to do with a New Year’s resolution? Well, I think that these resolutions are inhibiting our ability to perform more.
    <br/><br/>
	One of my friends had made it his New Year’s resolution to eat healthier so he could lose weight. However, after two and a half weeks of “healthy eating,” he gave up and resumed his diet from the previous year. Afterward, he convinced himself that he had already failed his resolution for the year and that he would try again next year, hopefully coming back stronger.
    <br/><br/>
	This mentality of <u>attaching a goal to a timeframe</u> (a whole year of 365 days) is problematic. According to a report from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2019/12/21/the-top-3-reasons-new-years-resolutions-fail-and-how-yours-can-succeed/?sh=2d6b84596992">Forbes</a>, around 80% of Americans fail their New Year’s Resolutions.
    <br/><br/>
    As humans, we are taught that failure builds success. However, this belief provides us with the cushion which ultimately leaves us <b>too much room for failure</b>.
    <br/><br/>
    Instead, I think that we should be actively aware of our resolutions and goals and be able to differentiate them. By no means am I trying to convince you that a New Year’s resolution is worthless...But I <i>am</i> trying to convince you to be articulate and cautious of what you set your New Year’s resolution to be. I hope that your takeaway from this is to <b>just</b> do and don’t think.
    <br/><br/>
    2020 has been a tough year for all of us. I hope that 2021 brings us a fresh start and the future shines a bright light.
    <br/><br/>
    Cheers,
	Alston'
