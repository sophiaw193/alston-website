	<br/><br/>
	Now, take a moment and think about what you said at the end of last year...
	<br/><br/>
	Well, to be frank, I don’t remember the last time I set a New Year’s resolution for myself. And if I did, it would probably be back in high school where I made it my goal to climb the ladders in a video game called League of Legends. (I did peak at Diamond Four, if you were even remotely curious)
	<br/><br/>
	Over the years, I have stopped making New Year’s resolutions. It is not because I sucked at accomplishing them, but rather I have become aware of what separates a resolution from just another goal on my bucket list. 
	I have some goals on my bucket list, including 1) backpacking in Southeast Asia 2) producing a short film and 3) flying around to play in EPTs (European Poker Tour). The list is only growing as I am getting older. However, I began to notice that different goals on my bucket list required different levels of time, health, and money. 
	For example, backpacking in Southeast Asia will take a dedicated amount of time, a healthy body, and relatively smaller amounts of money to complete. Since I should have the most time and the best health in my younger years, I figured I probably should get to that as soon as possible.
	At the same time, I look at other goals of producing a short film and attending poker tournaments as goals that I can accomplish even with deteriorating health in my later years. Therefore, these goals are set at the very bottom of the bucket.
	You might ask what the heck is this guy blabbering about and what does all this have to do with a New Year’s resolution? Well, I think that these resolutions are inhibiting our ability to perform more. 
	One of my friends had made it his New Year’s resolution to eat healthier so he could lose weight. However, after two and a half weeks of “healthy eating,” he gave out and resumed his diet from the previous year. Afterward, he told himself that he had already failed his resolution for the year and that he would try again next year, hopefully coming back stronger. 
	This mentality of attaching a goal to a whole year of 365 days - or 366 days every four years if you really want to technical - is problematic. According to a report from Forbes, around 80% of Americans fail their New Year’s Resolutions. 
	As humans, we are taught that failure builds success. However, this belief provides us with the cushion which ultimately leaves us too much room for failure. 
	Instead, I think that we should be actively aware of our resolutions and goals and be able to differentiate them. By no means am I trying to convince you that a New Year’s resolution is worthless...But I am trying to convince you to be articulate and cautious of what you set your New Year’s resolution to be. I hope that your takeaway from this is to just do and don’t think.
	2020 has been a tough year for all of us. I hope that 2021 brings us a fresh start and the future shines a bright light.
	Cheers,
	Alston'
